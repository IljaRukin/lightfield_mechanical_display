This can be used to reduce the speckle noise (with a random phase) or to encode a second image at some distance $z_0$. To do the later, first the two images to be displayed distance $z_0$ apart are iteratively transformed into each other with the fresnel integral and starting with a random phase, to determine the needed phase of the first image to produce the second image amplitude. Than this phase can be used in the gerchberg-saxon-algorithm to compute the amplitude/phase modulation to reconstruct the first image and it's phase for the second image.
